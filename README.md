# EEPROM Programmer

This Windows application reads/writes 28-pin EEPROMs (sucha as 28C64, 28C128, etc.). An Arduino Mega and a custom PCB provide the hardware to connect the EEPROM.

This Visual Studio 2022 project uses .NET Framework. It is written in C# and provides a Windows Forms user interface.

Please see the [EEPROM Programmer] web site for more information.
